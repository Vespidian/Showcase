<h1 id="my-journey-making-a-3d-game-engine">My Journey Making a 3D Game
Engine</h1>
<p>When I first started in 2020 with attempting to make a game, I barely
knew any C. All I had done up to this point was write an x86 bootloader
in assembly, attempt to do something in Unity using C# and play around
with command line C programs.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="foxandbox">FoxandBox</h3>
<p>This early dive into game and engine development was heavily
influenced by Stardew Valley and Pokemon. Everything from the tile based
level to the art style.</p>
<p><img src="Images/particleSystem.gif" /></p>
<p>I started off using just SDL2 and learned everything from <a
href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/">Lazy Foo's tutorials</a> In
the beginning my language of choice was C and that has remained. This is
logically a somewhat odd choice but its just personal preference for the
simplicity and control i have with C. I could just as easily have done
all of this in something more suitable like C++ <em>but wheres the fun
in that?</em></p>
<p><img src="Images/speed.gif" /></p>
<p>After level creation and movement was done, I worked on level
interaction and automatic calculation of the borders between tile types.
I did these calculations using a method similar to a cellular automaton.
Each configuration of the 8 neighbours of a tile is assigned an index
into the tilemap below. This later proved to not work too well for
intersections of more than 2 materials, but for 2 materials the effect
is quite nice. <img src="Images/autotile_mask.png" /> <img
src="Images/fasterEditing.gif" /></p>
<p>I developed an immediate mode (as opposed to a retained mode) UI
library from scratch for this project which I used for the inventory and
menus. Designing a good UI library is hard.. You'll see this theme come
up a couple times again when I talk about my 3D engine as well. The UI
of this game was very bare bones and crude but it worked well enough for
my uses.</p>
<p><img src="Images/pause.gif" /> <img src="Images/checkbox.gif" /></p>
<p>I then used this UI system to make a cute little inventory system
which served absolutely no purpose. Well, it would've served a purpose
if i'd had any planning for the direction the game should've taken. But,
alas, I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
<p><img src="Images/itemDrop.gif" /> <img
src="Images/groundItems.gif" /></p>
<p>This project was ended when I attempted to expand the game to support
a fully procedurally generated map. By this point the code base was a
mess and memory leaks were popping up like a game of whack-a-mole (I got
pretty far considering this was my first project of this scale).</p>
<p>Although this game never ended up coming to anything, it taught me an
incredible amount about basic programming, C, and engine development.
This game is the catalyst which later drove me to make a 3D game engine.
I deem this project was a success, even though there was no end goal to
begin with.</p>

<h3 id="tuff---the-first-attempt">Tuff - The first attempt</h3>
<p>Insert why switch to open GL</p>
<p>Originally, the only reason i wanted to switch to opengl was so I
could rotate sprites, but I was too tempted by the ability to go 3D.</p>
<p><img src="Images/opengl_renderer.gif" /> <img
src="Images/slider.gif" /></p>
<p>I used the wonderfully well made site <a
href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> by Joey de Vries to get
started with basic 3D rendering. Once i'd gotten a fairly loose grasp on
using opengl and toyed around with writing some shaders, my priorities
changed, I no longer wanted to make a game, I wanted to make a game
engine instead.</p>
<p>By this point I had a comfortable grasp of most of C and abided by a
fair amount of good coding practices (not enough). I went through and
worked my way through the tutorial series. Starting off with .obj 3D
model parsing / loading. Doing this early on helped immensely with
mentally mapping from a 3D object and its triangles to the vertex data
the GPU takes in.</p>
<p><img src="Images/crate.gif" /></p>
<p>I followed the tutorials up to the point of basic specular lighting
and then toyed around with some different models and normal / bump
maps.</p>
<p><img src="Images/more_lighting.gif" /> <img
src="Images/shiny.gif" /></p>
<p>Now comes the second attempt at a UI library. This time I went with a
retained mode UI and modeled it after a combination of html and css. I
used <a href="https://github.com/zserge/jsmn">JSMN</a> to tokenize JSON
files and then parsed the contents from there. UI files contained a
style section for element classes and a hierarchical scene section for
the elements themselves. Classes can be applied to elements and classes
can with mouse actions such as hovering or clicking.</p>
<p>I needed to change up my approach if i wanted to have a usable
program with hot reloading and no memory leaks</p>
<p>At this point, I wasn't following the tutorials on LearnOpenGL in
order, I was using it more as a reference whenever I wanted to figure
out how to do something. I spent a while messing around with shaders
since you can very easily get some incredibly complex effects. Heres a
few of my favourite:</p>
