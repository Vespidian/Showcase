<p>[SMD components only] I started off by soldering all the surface
mount components so that any larger components don't get in the way. I
purposefully used a larger capacitor to couple the oscillator to it's
buffer stage so that I could use it to bridge over the track without
needing a two layer board.</p>
<p>[Picture with varicap offscreen] [Picture with varicap] I then added
all the non SMD components. For the CC (common collector) buffer stage
transistor I initially used a 2N2222 since I've a much more plentiful
supply of them than BFS17. For the tank circuit I used a 15pF capactior,
an air core inductor I estimated to be around 10nH, and a crude attempt
at a homemade variable capactior. I opted to leave out the RF choke
between the two stages simply because I was lazy. I just bridged the gap
with a wire instead.</p>
<p>[simulation showing current draw] Once assembled, I power it at 5V
through a 1kOhm resistor and make sure the current draw is less than the
5mA the resistor would allow (it drew about 1mA which is in line with
the simulation). I check for any shorts and make sure the bias voltages
look fine. The moment of truth comes, I start up my spectrum analyzer
(an RTLSDR and <a
href="https://github.com/pavels/spektrum">spektrum</a>) and...
Nothing.</p>
<p>What I believe happened here is, since I used the 2N2222 - which
isn't rated to work above 300MHz - for the buffer stage, it was putting
too heavy a load on the oscillator and damping out any oscillations.</p>
<p>Before I switched out the transistor I swapped out the variable
capacitor for a static 47pF capacitor. Still no dice, I probably could
have kept the variable cap but I ended up going another less finicky
route to dial in the frequency.</p>
<p>[Image showing 270 fundamental and 542 harmonic] With the 2N2222
swapped for a faster switching BFS17 It worked! But as expected, at the
wrong frequency. By looking at the frequency I could estimate the value
of my inductor; Assuming the capacitors are perfect and no parasitics. I
calculated an inductance of 26.2nH which is pretty far off from what I
thought it would be.</p>
<p>[Image showing finished board] After dealing with stability issues
for an hour I finally caved and put in the RF choke like I was supposed
to do to begin with. This immediately resulted in a much cleaner and
more stable signal - oh how annoying past me can be sometimes.</p>
<p>[Image of simulation showing small second harmonic] [Image from
spektrum showing similar amplitudes for harmonics] From the simulation I
knew there would be a bit of clipping causing a visible second harmonic
but what I wasnt expecting was for said harmonic to be about as strong
as the fundamental. Note: It probably isn't really as strong as the
fundamental but looking at signal strength using a RTLSDR shows it as
about the same and thats the only tool I have that is able to measure
signal strength.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see just how sensitive the frequency is to my
hand or other conductive objects in close proximity.</p>
<p>Because of the strength of the second harmonic I had the idea to
bring it down to 433MHz instead of bringing the fundamental up. Bringing
it down ends up being easier since I can use a bigger value for the
inductor and keep the capacitors the same size.</p>
<p>To dial in the frequency I used the inductor. I calculated that I
would need 3 turns to bring the frequency down slightly lower than
433MHz. I then stretched out the inductor - lowering its inductance and
increasing the resonant frequency - until it resonated at 433MHz.</p>
<p>[Picture of transistor switch test] With the oscillator stable and
working, I decided to test if it would work at 4.3V which would be
required if i want to switch it on and off with a transistor. Although
as I write this I realize the current draw is low enough it could
probably be switched directly from a microcontroller's GPIO pin. Well
nonetheless it still oscillates at 4.3V although theres very little
leeway since it stops oscillating at around 4.1V</p>
<p>[Resulting 216 spectrum] [Resulting 433 spectrum] All in all im quite
pleased with the results, I still have to figure out an enclosure so
mitigate frequency drift as well as an output filter to get rid of the
216MHz oscillation; But the hard part is done.</p>
